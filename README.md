# ADM-HW4-Group14

This repository contains the answers to **Homework 4** of the class **ADM**. Detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/Sapienza-University-Rome/ADM/tree/master/2024/Homework_4).

Specially, the file structure is as follows:
```        
Project       
├── README.md         
├── main.ipynb
├── MinHash.py     #Class MinHash       
├── data                            
    ├── .gitkeep             

```

The file holding the answers is available as [main.ipynb](https://github.com/TealMango/ADM-HW4-Group14/blob/main/main.ipynb).

To correctly execute the main.ipynb file, the required datasets must be downloaded from Kaggle, as they are not included in the current repository. These datasets should be placed in a folder named "data", which must be located in the same directory as the main.ipynb file.
